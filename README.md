## 🧠 About Me

Software Engineer (B.Sc. Computer Science, 2025) with hands-on experience building production-grade full-stack and mobile applications.

I specialize in:

- Designing REST APIs and backend systems
- Containerized development using Docker
- Linux-based deployments with Nginx
- CI/CD automation
- Scalable SaaS systems

I enjoy working on systems that require clean architecture, performance optimization, and reliability at scale.

Currently exploring opportunities where I can contribute to backend systems, distributed architecture, and high-performance services.
